<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<p>I am a software developer and computer enthusiast.  I'm also a father, husband and armed forces veteran.  
    I enjoy running, video games, movies and jigsaw puzzles.
</p>
<p>I have been working with computers for almost 30 years and I'm still awed and inspired by
the endless possibilities they enable.  I love a challenge and am always looking for fresh opportunities.
